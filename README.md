BRIEF EXPLANATION - 

  This project is for CSUF's CPSC349 Project 1 wherein students are tasked with creating a quiz app from scratch using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. This project features a home page, a list of games to play with results showing at the end
  of each session, a navigation bar at the top that can take users to the home page, an about us page, as well as a user log in or sign up page. The log in/ sign up is NOT functioning as backend was not part of the project specifications so that is only
  for showcasing purposes.
